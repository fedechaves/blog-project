The full list of keywords and reserved

break case catch class const continue debugger default
delete do else enum export extends false finally for
function if implements import interface in instanceof let
new package private protected public return static super
switch this throw true try typeof var void while with yield

Don’t worry about memorizing this list. When creating a binding
produces an unexpected syntax error, see whether you’re trying to define a reserved word.
